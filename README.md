# Acorn#
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MatthewSmit/AcornSharp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MatthewSmit/AcornSharp)

A tiny, fast JavaScript parser, written in C# and ported from [acorn](https://github.com/ternjs/acorn).
Currently based off acorn 6.0.4 (https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/commit/58603fd85ae4655e62df5dffaeb4853c3a198e20).

Acorn# does not support the loose parse, only the full parser.
